# Tim Doesn't Want You To Cook

Things you shouldn't do with OS X because Apple said so god damnit.

- [El Capitan Post-Install Tools](http://www.tonymacx86.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=294)

Apple doesn't want you to run OS X on anything besides a Mac. So you'll never
need these Post Installation tools that OSX86 (\*cough\*hackintosh\*cough\*)
users provide to install El Capitan on PC hardware.

- [MultiBeast 8](http://www.tonymacx86.com/announcements/175597-multibeast-8-0-update.html)

Again, you won't run OS X on anything besides a Mac so you'll never need to
install this special bootloader, drivers, and fixes for running OS X 10.11 on PC
hardware.

- [UniBeast](http://www.tonymacx86.com/el-capitan-desktop-guides/172672-unibeast-install-os-x-el-capitan-any-supported-intel-based-pc.html)

Since you only run OS X on purchased and licensed Apple products, the following
guide is completely useless as a walkthrough for updating to or installing a
fresh version of OS X El Capitan.

**You've been warned!**
